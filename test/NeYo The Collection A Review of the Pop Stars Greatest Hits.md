One of the highlights of The Collection is the song Closer, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 2009. The song is a departure from Ne-Yo's usual R&B style, as it incorporates elements of dance-pop and electro. The song is inspired by the music of Michael Jackson and Prince, and it features a catchy chorus and a pulsating beat. The song is about being attracted to someone and wanting to get closer to them on the dance floor.
 
Another standout track is Miss Independent, which was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2009. The song is a tribute to independent women who can take care of themselves and don't need a man to support them. The song has a smooth and groovy vibe, and it features a guest appearance by rapper Fabolous. The song was also sampled by Jay-Z on his hit single Run This Town, which featured Rihanna and Kanye West.
 
The Collection also includes some of Ne-Yo's collaborations with other artists, such as Do You with Utada and Because of You (Remix) with Kanye West. Do You is a tender ballad that expresses regret and longing for a former lover. The song is sung in both English and Japanese, and it showcases the chemistry between Ne-Yo and Utada. Because of You (Remix) is a more upbeat and energetic version of the original song, which features Kanye West's rap verses and Ne-Yo's vocals. The song is about being addicted to someone who makes you feel good.
